    with libarchive.file_reader('test.7z') as archive:
        for entry in archive:
            for block in entry.get_blocks():
                ...

Use ``libarchive.memory_reader`` if you want to read from a buffer instead.

To create an archive::

    with libarchive.file_writer('test.tar.gz', 'ustar', 'gzip') as archive:
        archive.add_files('libarchive/', 'README.rst')

Use ``libarchive.fd_writer`` if you want to write to a file descriptor instead.
